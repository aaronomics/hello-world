Hello!

I am hoping to learn some things about coding to see if a career change might be possible for me! I don't really enjoy working retail or in restaurants and I do enjoy using my computer to solve problems, so I thought I'd at least try out the basics to see if I can handle it.

Thanks,

Aaron.
